# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLOv5

This project demonstrates real-time object detection in live video streams using the YOLOv5 model. It utilizes the pretrained `yolov5s` from Ultralytics for efficient and accurate detection on webcam footage.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Develop a system capable of detecting and tracking objects in real-time video streams using deep learning models like YOLOv5 or Faster R-CNN.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv5** (from Ultralytics)

---

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time object detection using webcam
- Accurate bounding boxes with class labels
- Easy to extend for object tracking (e.g., with Deep SORT)
